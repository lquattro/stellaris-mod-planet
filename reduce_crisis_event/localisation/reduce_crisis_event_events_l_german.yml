Counter terrorists foiled the attempt.\n\nWe are still trying to piece together exactly what happened, but it appears that several members of its command staff, including the chief engineer, had been replaced by Synthetic infiltrators.\n\nThis is how they had to succeed to approach the energy generators of the spaceport with a bomb.\n\nFortunately counter terrorists [Root.GetName] intervened and managed to stop the infiltrators."

We are still trying to piece together exactly what happened, but it appears that several members of its command staff, including the chief engineer, had been replaced by Synthetic infiltrators.\n\nThat's how they were able to plant a bomb on the generators of the spaceport. Most of the station's crew managed to evacuate to the surface of [Root.GetName] before it was destroyed, but the losses in both material and property are substantial."
